# Scanning-Helium-Microscope-Diffraction-Measuement-Simulation-Newcastle

Created by **Ke Wang**.

It is an interactive script that simulates the diffraction measurement of the SHeM at the University of Newcastle. It allows different surface lattice structures and different detector geometry to be simulated. The input of the Multiscat is also implemented, which makes it a good script to visualize the multiscat result.
